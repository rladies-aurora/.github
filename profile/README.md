# Welcome to R-Ladies Aurora 👋
R-Ladies Aurora (RLA) is a chapter of [R-Ladies Global](//rladies.org), an organization whose mission is to promote gender diversity in the R programming community. This non-profit, civil society community is designed to develop members’ R skills & knowledge through social, collaborative learning & sharing. Supporting minority identity access to STEM skills & careers, the Free Software Movement, and contributing to the global R community!

RLA welcomes R-enthusiasts of all proficiency levels, including aspiring and experienced R programmers, who are interested in mentoring, networking & expertise upskilling. Anyone and everyone interested in R/Data Science should [join the group](//meetup.com/rladies-aurora) — all genders are welcome at RLA meetups, and participants must follow the R-Ladies [code of conduct](https://guide.rladies.org/about/coc/). We encourage members to actively participate, contributing as learners, teachers, developers, or innovators! We encourage women and minority genders to present/lead most sessions and conversations, but we have no restrictions whatsoever about who can participate in membership, discussions, and other activities. Please join us and bring your R-family & R-friends!
